\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we give an in depth overview of variational autoencoders and
highlight the most prominent adversarial attacks. We see that progress has been
made at bridging the gap between variational autoencoders and adversarial
examples, but not much work has been done to combine both research topics. Future work could
investigate whether variational autoencoders or any other generative model help
at generating strong adversarial attacks and defenses and make state-of-the-art
machine learning systems more robust.
