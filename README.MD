## Master Thesis [WIP]

Chair: [Chair of Data science](http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/data-science/)  
Supervisor: [Prof. Dr. Michael Granitzer](http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/media-computer-science/team/)  
Topic: Software Design Patterns for Machine Learning Workflows  
Deadline: 7.1.2020

 #### Topic description
 Software Engineering defines standard procedures and design patterns for developing complex software products. Such an approach does not exist for machine learning yet. Quite contrary, machine learning is most often driven in an ad-hoc, trial and error manner.

The goal of the thesis is to investigate, how and which software design patterns can be transferred to machine learning workflows. The student needs to develop design patterns and best practices for implementing machine learning workflows and implement and evaluate selected parts of the design pattern. Examples could be Unit Testing for ML Workflows, transfer of models amongst domains (aka Transfer Learning) or the identification of extreme, adversarial examples (adversarial learning).

The master thesis is conducted with the [SCCH Hagenberg](https://www.scch.at/en/news).
